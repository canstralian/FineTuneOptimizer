# FineTuneOptimizer

**FineTuneOptimizer** is a Python library designed to help developers fine-tune and optimize pre-trained machine learning models. It provides an easy-to-use interface for applying fine-tuning techniques, evaluating model performance, and enhancing the results of pre-trained models on specific datasets.

This repository focuses on automating and streamlining the fine-tuning process to improve model accuracy and task-specific performance. It integrates seamlessly with Hugging Face and other machine learning frameworks.

## Key Features:
- **Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tune pre-trained models to improve performance for specific tasks.
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Tune hyperparameters to get the best results with minimal computational overhead.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of fine-tuned models using various metrics.
- **Integration with Hugging Face**: Easily deploy models to Hugging Face for further usage and sharing.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Supports multiple optimization methods and model architectures.

## Installation

To install FineTuneOptimizer, use pip:

```
pip install fine-tune-optimizer
'''
Alternatively, you can clone this repository and install the dependencies manually:

'''
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FineTuneOptimizer.git
cd FineTuneOptimizer
pip install -r requirements.txt
'''

Usage

Fine-Tuning a Model

To fine-tune a model on your custom dataset:

from fine_tune_optimizer import FineTuner

# Initialize FineTuner with pre-trained model
fine_tuner = FineTuner(model_name='bert-base-uncased')

# Load your custom dataset
train_dataset, test_dataset = load_data('your_dataset_path')

# Fine-tune the model
fine_tuner.train(train_dataset, epochs=3, batch_size=16)

# Evaluate the model
metrics = fine_tuner.evaluate(test_dataset)
print(metrics)

Hyperparameter Optimization

FineTuneOptimizer allows automatic hyperparameter optimization. Use the HyperOptimizer class to tune your model’s hyperparameters:

from fine_tune_optimizer import HyperOptimizer

hyper_optimizer = HyperOptimizer(model_name='bert-base-uncased')
best_params = hyper_optimizer.optimize(train_dataset)

# Apply the best parameters
fine_tuner.apply_best_params(best_params)

Model Evaluation

After fine-tuning, evaluate the model’s performance using the following metrics:

metrics = fine_tuner.evaluate(test_dataset)
print(metrics)

Supported Models

FineTuneOptimizer supports various pre-trained models available in Hugging Face, including:
   •   BERT
   •   GPT-2
   •   RoBERTa
   •   T5
